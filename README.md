# 🩺 Active Learning for Pneumonia Detection  

This repository contains the **code, report, and visualizations** for the **Active Learning framework** applied to pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to **optimize dataset labeling** by implementing an **Active Learning strategy** for training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is designed to improve classification accuracy while reducing the need for extensive labeled data.  

## 📂 Available Files  
- **`ActiveLearningPneumoniaDetection.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.  
- **`Project-AI-MEI-2024154464.pdf`** – Report detailing the methodology, implementation, and results.  
- **`Data and Results/`** – Contains images and visualizations related to data distribution, model performance, and Active Learning progression.  

⚠️ **The dataset is NOT provided in this repository** due to licensing restrictions.
